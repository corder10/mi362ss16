				<h1>Species Facts & Protection</h1>
				<p><i>"We focus our efforts on those species - like tigers, rhinos, whales and marine turtles - whose protection influences and supports the survival of other species or offers the opportunity to protect whole landscapes or marine areas."</i></p>

				<h3>Primates</h3>
				<ul>Chimpanzee's, our closest cousins of who we share about 98% of our genes, care for their offspring for years and can live to be over 50. Illegial wildlife tade is a prominent threat. Poaching has become commercialized to satisfy the wealthy urban residents, while infant chimps are frequently taken alive and sold in cities as pets. Unfortunately diseases such as ebola outbreaks are another threat, having killed tens of thousands of great apes. With a population of 172,700 to 299,700, this is a substantial amount.</ul>
				<ul>Orangutans are the largest arboreal mammals and share 96.4% of our genes. Deforestation, habitat loss, and hunting are the three largest threats to these highly intelligent creatures. It doesn't help that females give birth to only one infant at a time every 3-5 years, making their population highly vulnerable. </ul>

				<h3>Big Cats</h3>
				<ul>After 100 years, the Tiger population is finally rising! It was estimated in 2010 that there were 3,200 tigers out in the wild, and now there's around 3,890. One of WWF's goals is to double this number by 2022 (the next Year of the Tiger).</ul>
				<ul>Snow leopards have evolved to live in incredibly harsh conditions like the cold, rocky, and high mountains of the Himalayas, and their only predator is humans. One of the large threats to their species is climate change, which could result in a loss of up to 30% of the snow leopard population. Another threat is retaliatory killings. Farmers will often kill lepoards because they prey on livestock. But because their natural prey becomes harder to find with the climate changes and when the locals hunt the snow leopard's typical prey, they are forced to kill livestock. </ul>

			<div class = "marine">
				<h3>Marine Animals</h3>
				<ul>The blue whale is the largest animal on the planet, weighing as much as 200 tons (appx. 33 elephants). They are also the loudest animals on Earth and are even louder than a jet engine, their calls can reach 188 decibels.</ul>
				<ul>There are fewer than 200 galapagos penguins, which is the only penguin species found north of the equator and in the Galápagos.</ul>
				<ul>Leatherback turtles are named for their shell, which is leather-like rather than hard. Due to overharvesting, illegal trade, and fisheries bycatch this turtle is known only to survive in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalised population.</ul>
