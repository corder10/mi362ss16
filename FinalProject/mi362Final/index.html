				<p>The World Wildlife Fund (or WWF for short) is an organization dedicated to the protection and rejuvenation of the Earth and its creatures. From the turtles in the sea to the snow leopards in the mountains, WWF tries to help. But they cannot do any of this alone. Without the millions of people around the world that are willing to help, none of this could be possible. Fortunately, WWF has multiple ways for people like you and me to help. </p>
			
				<div class = "title">
					<p><i>"For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature."</i></p>

				<p> Below are two links you can use to <span class="donateText">Donate</span> to support WWF's Global Conservation Efforts or <span class="adoptText">Adopt</span> a species that will help protect the future of nature. Your donation would make you a member of WWF and you could elect to recieve a Thank-You gift, such as: a Green Water Bottle with the WWF symol on it, or two Amazon totes. If you decide to adopt a wild animal, you can recieve various gifts such as a plush version of your adopted animal, a gift bag, and a formal adoption certificate. Your symbolic adoption supports WWF's gloal efforts to protect wild animals and their habitats. </p>
